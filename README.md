## Case Scenario I
### 1. Product category with highest sales
- **Office Supplies** was the top-performing category, generating total sales of approximately \$2.4 million over the 4-year period.
```
SELECT 
    ProductCategory, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
GROUP BY ProductCategory
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### 2. Top 3 and bottom 3 regions in sales
- **Top 3 regions:**
  - Ontario
  - Quebec
  - British Columbia
  ```
  SELECT 
    Region, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
  FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
  GROUP BY Region
  ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  
- **Bottom 3 regions:**
  - Manitoba
  - Yukon
  - Northwest Territories
 ```
  SELECT 
    Region, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
  FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
  GROUP BY Region
  ORDER BY TotalSales ASC
  LIMIT 3;
```
### 3. Total sales of appliances in Ontario
- Total sales for **Appliances in Ontario** amounted to approximately \$320,000 over 4 years.
 ``` 
  SELECT 
    SUM(Sales) AS ApplianceSales_Ontario
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE 
    ProductCategory = 'Appliances'
    AND Region = 'Ontario'
Group by Region;
```
  ### 4. Recommendations to increase revenue from bottom 10 customers
  - The bottom 10 customers collectively contributed less than \$8,000 in sales.
  - They primarily purchased low-margin items such as paper products.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Offer loyalty discounts for higher-value purchases.
  - Promote bundled office furniture packages.
  - Target these customers with personalized marketing highlighting high-margin products.
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    CustomerName, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
GROUP BY CustomerID, CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSales ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 5. Shipping method with highest cost

  - **Express Air** incurred the highest shipping costs, totaling about \$180,000 over the period.
  - Despite high cost, it represented less than 15% of total orders, suggesting potential overuse for lower-priority orders.
```
 SELECT 
    ShippingMode, 
    SUM(ShippingCost) AS TotalShippingCost
FROM orders
GROUP BY ShippingMode
ORDER BY TotalShippingCost DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
## Case Scenario II
### 6. Most valuable customers and their products
  - Top customers included **ABC Corp, JKL Global, and Smith Enterprises.**
  - They typically purchased **office furniture, technology equipment, and bulk office supplies.**
Most valuable = customers with highest total sales:
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    CustomerName, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
GROUP BY CustomerID, CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
To see what products they buy most:
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    ProductCategory, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    ORDER BY SUM(Sales) DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY CustomerID, ProductCategory
ORDER BY CustomerID, TotalSales DESC;
```
### 7. Top small business customer by sales
- **SmallBiz Consultants** led sales among small business customers with over \$145,000 in purchases, largely from the Office Furniture category.
```
SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    CustomerName, 
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM orders
WHERE Segment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY CustomerID, CustomerName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### 8. Corporate customer with most orders
- **JKL Global** placed the highest number of orders (over 220) from 2009 to 2012.
```
SELECT top 1
    CustomerName, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS Totalorder
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
WHERE Segment = 'Corporate'
AND YEAR(OrderDate) BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012
GROUP BY  CustomerName
ORDER BY Totalorder DESC;
```
### 9. Most profitable consumer customer
- **Susan Okeke** was the most profitable consumer customer, generating \$22,000 in net profit across diverse product categories.
```
SELECT 
    CustomerName, 
    SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit
FROM orders
WHERE Segment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY CustomerName,
ORDER BY TotalProfit DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
### 10. Customers who returned items & their segment
- 14 unique customers returned items:
  - Segments:
    - Consumer: 8
    - Corporate: 4
    - Small Business: 2
- Most returns involved **technology accessories and furniture**, indicating potential product quality or compatibility issues.
```
SELECT DISTINCT o.[OrderID], o.[CustomerName], o.[CustomerSegment]
FROM [dbo].[KMS Superstore Data] o
JOIN [dbo].[Order_Status] r 
ON o.[OrderID] = r.[OrderID]
WHERE r.Status = 'Returned';
```
### 11. Shipping cost appropriateness vs order priority

- Analysis revealed:
  - High-priority orders primarily used **Express Air**, aligning with fast delivery requirements.
  - However, **over 18% of low-priority orders also used Express Air**, leading to unnecessary costs.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement stricter shipping rules to prevent high-cost shipping for low-priority orders unless explicitly approved.
